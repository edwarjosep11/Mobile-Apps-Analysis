2017-11-01 13:11:52,i have two accounts for a reason one for personal use and the other one for my business before it was very easy to hop between accounts and use them for different reasons as they have a different purpose the new updates stops all of this i had two accounts because i didn t want my business followers to see my personal stories i also followed different people on the two different accounts for a reason i followed friends on my personal pages and work related accounts on my business page this kept the two this separate now my personal page stories are also posted to my business account due to the update i don t not want my business followers to see what i m up to at the weekend or what i m cooking etc you may as well only let people have one account if the new update is going to show everything on both accounts another bad thing is the people i follow on both accounts are now merged crammed into one feed and are all mixed up i followed different people on the different accounts for a reason please fix this update as it stops me being able to use instagram for both reasons ,5,False,Emilie12345,New updates issues!,Instagram
2023-01-12 17:21:45,so i noticed that instagram s community is terribly toxic and problematic all the time people are always rude to each other and are always starting arguments in comments over the most stupidest things the service is absolutely terrible when you try to report someone who has been cyber bullying you or your friend instagram comes up with this lame excuse to not take that account down because of too many reports of that account which just sounds lazy to me another thing instagram doesn t take posts down that goes to community guidelines but when it comes to my posts they do take it down even though it doesn t even go towards the community guidelines and the algorithm is absolutely terrible please fix this app i ve used it for 3 years now and saying this with experience the app is extremely toxic whatsoever it doesn t even let you comment the word gay as a joke because that word goes to the community guidelines which is homophobic and unbelievable not only that you literally banned me from using the add yours stickers and the option to react to messages and reply to them please fix this my instagram is up to date and it still does not work it also does not let me use the most recent updates features either this app is not fair i do not recommend downloading if you don t want your mental health messed up my mental health has been so messed up because of instagram this app is a complete joke and it s fake as anything ,1,False,"Emily Roberts,age 13",Terrible support.,Instagram
2022-03-14 11:12:44,i always enjoyed using instagram for me it was a good platform to express my creativity until instagram became bias and stopped giving everyone the same user experience on my account both personal and business i m not able to edit my reels anymore rearrange clips i had this option for maybe a month and then it miraculously disappeared i got excited thinking that s a new feature i was always missing until i found out that some users accounts were able to do that all along it s not giving every user equal opportunities so to speak i don t mind it becoming more of a video platform but the problem is that i can t even edit my clips i feel very limited and i think it s just discrimination perhaps based on how many followers you have and etc why some users are able to have additional options and others don t it s not a bug or a phone and etc i ve updated my app installed and uninstalled it nothing s changed it all started with this whole likes experiment some accounts were able to see likes some not and etc now they re experimenting on people with reels it s beyond disappointing if you want people to keep using it more engagement then give everyone same tools otherwise everyone will move on to different apps and instagram will be left with a limited amount of users and demographics ,2,False,Sauleee333,"Not as good as used to be, becoming bias",Instagram
2022-07-09 23:22:20,yes like others i don t like the new layout and agree forcing to make a reel to post a video is a ridiculous decision but we ll get used to it i guess however removing the ability to mute videos across the app and forcing users to use the volume control which controls volume for our entire phone is ridiculous why should i have to stop listening to my music while scrolling because dear ig developers turning down the sound on our phones means we can t view ig while listening to our music because we ve had to turn the main volume down how could this not be realised or have to remember to turn my volume back up once i leave the app or have to quickly turn down the volume lest annoy those around me because a reel generally one that is a misguided advertisement i m not interested in anyway starts playing and i don t have my headphones on please return the app specific ability to mute sound instead of taking the pretty aggressive and somewhat egotistical approach where users have to adjust their entire phone for this one app also remember this was a photography forward app if you want an app to rival tiktok then for pete s sake just make one don t repurpose this one but as that will fall on deaf ears at least listen to the masses of people about the sound control that was really a poor decision ,2,False,Aliann747,Removing sound control was a mistake,Instagram

2022-07-06 13:15:30,i ve had instagram for about 6 years now and i never had issues until about 2 3 years ago my account would randomly get banned when i never do anything against instagrams guidelines and it s never just a simple date to date ban it goes on for about 2 months straight if for example i like something after my first original ban it will automatically trigger something to start a new ban and it will be longer this never used to happen but i get banned about 3 times a year now since this started another thing the instagram stories me and many other users have been having to rewatch stories we ve already seen constantly again and again and if it s not rewatching the stories it s as if the stories have crashed they never pop up at the top of my page anymore it always says i ve seen them all which i don t have the time to watch them because i follow so many people but it s just saying i ve seen every story which i haven t and i sometimes actually want to see some of the people i follow stories i don t know if this is because you could be sorting out the stories with the rewatching issue but it s now triggered a new issue for me my instagram is all up to date i have refreshed it all and also logged out a couple times to see if any improvement but nothing ,2,False,judemwilson,Issue after issue,Instagram
2022-05-08 01:15:23,recently instagram has decided to copy half of tik tok s features this includes their reels which are just incredibly annoying and out of sync with the rest of the app i preferred instagram s old saving method where you could hold down the save option icon and add a video to multiple save section folders over the new way of saving which is to press the three dots at the top of the video and select save and then add to a collection meaning you can only add the video to one collection unless you want to spend the time going all the way to the other collections you wanted the post in and going into its settings and adding the post manually tik tok actually has imo a worse saving system anyways so instagram copying it is a very strange and annoying move also instagram is forcing every video posted to be a reel unless of course it s a multiple media post which in turn people often feel forced to post instead of a one picture video post as to avoid the post being a reel this can be annoying in itself as instagram doesn t show the amount of views on a multi image video post only the amount of likes instagram please stop trying to copy tik tok and listen to what your users actually want it s not reels ,3,False,Gotham Sandwich,Instagram’s recent blunders,Instagram
2021-11-05 09:10:37,i have a business account on instagram which is linked to a page on facebook however everytime i write a post on instagram that i also want to post to fb it takes me hours to troubleshoot why it isn t doing so i can see both accounts are linked to one another on both platforms so i unlink and link on both platforms then try logging in and out of both platforms then try switching my phone off and on then i delete and reinstall the instagram app and i repeat all of this in a different order over and over again until i am enabled to push that share to facebook button on my post but what works once doesn t work the next time so i have to go through the whole process everytime i do a post also everytime i log out of insta and log back in all draft posts are deleted so i have to redo my post again just to see if that button works it s so incredibly frustrating it takes me hours sometimes days to fix it and it just seems random what works i ve also tries just posting on insta first then using the share function afterwards but that again randomly works sometimes and doesn t please fix this it s making it so frustrating running a small business on instagram but not as frustrating as running a page on fb i ll give it that ,2,False,peepoi,Issue syncing Instagram to FB,Instagram
2022-07-24 05:12:20,i didn t really use instagram in the past until recently but i don t post so i m not having the same issues as other people but one thing that i found quite annoying was that before i completely reset my iphone my instagram accounts weren t working and by that i mean when i went on some of my accounts on instagram the wi fi would just completely go and i couldn t view or post anything there were a few of my accounts that didn t do this which i thought was strange because it wasn t in the order i created them and i m someone who creates a lot of accounts so if that a an issue they should be able to at least fix that with all the money they make from this trash experimental app i can t be bothered to post anything and i certainly don t view strangers posts unlike pinterest which is a lot more useful and has quick feed i now only use instagram to follow my friends and look at a few peoples posts who i searched up and followed myself another thing i don t like is that you can t fully delete an account since i create lots of accounts i like to get rid of them to free up space but they are very easy to get back and they don t erase the account from your email meaning you can t use the same email twice at least that s what the case with me is ,2,False,myaa7264,Not sure what happened,Instagram
2020-11-01 07:16:41,of all the social media platforms i use this the most and really enjoy checking it throughout the day sadly the latest update has made some really counter intuitive changes the three main buttons add content likes and messages are now bunched up in the top right corner in order to make lots of room at the bottom for reels and a shopping button i assume these two buttons have been given all this extra space as a way of promo it feels like they are trying to make the app have too many functions and buttons a cluttered interface a bit like facebook oh dear there is no longer any satisfaction in seeing the likes you receive for your posts as they either don t show up in an icon to notify you when you check the app when you do check you can no longer see individual user s likes in chronological order they are now grouped up i don t know why surely this works against the entire point of the app i discover other people this way and use it to see who regular interacts with my posts i m completely stumped as to why that would be changed a total own goal that gives the impression that the app is losing popularity and was in need of drastic change i hope they undo these changes or at least modify them more in line with what made the app popular ,1,False,BenjiNewman,Not sure why the developers want to sabotage their own app,Instagram
2018-08-14 09:33:38,one day some genius at instagram thought well it ain t broke so let s completely mess up a great app that was working perfectly for everyone and since i have changed phones and have had to re login to instagram i have been subject to the doom of the non chronological feed why on earth would i want to see things posted from 3 days ago at the top of my feed this update is horrendous non sensical and goes completely against the logical way to use the app people want to see things happening in the now not the before if the people at instagram hq have any sense they will listen to their customers small businesses and the like who use the app not only for their personal stuff but for their livelihood and give us back our chronological feeds update original point about having a non chronological feed still stand however i m experiencing a really annoying bug when i want to follow back someone who started following me as soon as i press the button i m met with an action blocked message every time i constantly report the problem but i never see that anything gets done about it it s incredibly frustrating because i have to try multiple times for my follow to not get the error message and actually follow someone successfully please fix ,3,False,Ubersupersam,An Insta-hot-mess of an app,Instagram
2020-11-18 17:40:54,instagram is rabidly declining and a majority of users agree with influencers through to casual users all being unhappy with the algorithm the new shopping tab and unholy amounts of advertising instagram was designed as a photo sharing creative space and platform no where s the creativity where s the ability to post whenever or whatever you want without being suppressed by the algorithm or having posts removed because it violence community guidelines which are not representative of the users of its platform the new shopping update clearly shows instagrams focus of money but as someone who works with vulnerable people i think the consideration of the fact pushing easy shopping into people s face is can not only be financially detrimental to some but also detrimental to those who are already feeling the pressures of society and social media needing to buy things to keep up with latest trends etc and of all time during a global pandemic where people are losing their jobs and livelihoods left right and centre read the room instagram ,5,False,ellaarees,Instagram: a priority of money over purpose,Instagram
2021-11-28 18:46:13,do not use two factor authentication i have lost access to my account because instagram support is useless and keep sending the same automated reply asking for more information when i literally sent them an entire paragraph of personal information about the account like the phone numbers used to make the account the device i used when it was made the email etc i ve told them i don t have access to the email i used to create the account because it s seven years old and not one i ve ever used the email i am messaging them on has literally been on the account for about 6 years they refuse to help me and because this account doesn t have personal photos of me i can t prove my identity this way the only reason i ve lost access is because my phone broke really suddenly so i can t get onto the authentication app this account is seven years old and they expect me to know every single tiny bit of information i will no longer use 2fa authentication which obviously makes my account vulnerable but i m not prepared to lose any more accounts because instagram cannot sort this issue out if you look online you will see i m not the only person to lose accounts because of 2 factor authentication and instagram refusing to help them i will now probably have to lose an account i ve had for seven years ,1,False,Ellie34067,Two factor authentication,Instagram
2021-10-19 15:52:24,let s say that i have loved instagram for a number of years i have over 30k followers on my account i have seen the app get worse and worse over the last few years the constant instagram downs leading to a change in the algorithm which basically leads to a reduction in the reach of your post facebook got charged with conducting social experiments on its users a while back so the people that manage this app are not adverse to messing with the psychological states of its users in order to pressure them to pay or promote their posts in order to reach the same amounts of people as they did before shame on you whilst allowing all sorts of shameful posts promotion of guns smoking weapons drinking they will do their best to take down posts that they deem to be against community guidelines usually under the line of adult solicitation if you show a model in a boudoir shoot or sometimes i am not even sure why there is someone that sits there and decides what is acceptable in society and i think it is extremely worrying to have people in this position especially considering what they do allow is this site being run by religious fundamentalists i d seriously consider going to another platform if you haven t already downloaded this app that would do you a huge favour and save you being exposed to this awful app ,1,False,Mind Carnival,Terrible service.,Instagram
2021-03-14 19:46:07,i was an instagram addict absolutely loved it and couldn t ever imagine having to survive without it until it became the source for all my troubles i wouldn t blame the app itself but more so the users and the people are what make the app i had a massive falling out with my friends and instagram was their little hub for bullying me i fell into severe depression and permanently deleted my account on october of 2019 since then and especially with the pandemic happening later on i had to survive without any communication and my mental health deteriorated due to the bullying i faced on this app i contemplated on making a new account and redownloading the app and did so due to the severe loneliness i was feeling due to the pandemic but without friends the app in my eyes was pretty much useless and i ended up deleting it again essentially instagram gives people more leverage in hurting others because they are behind a screen as with many social media apps and sites and that is a big problem in today s society i and i m sure many would agree with me hope that people can become kinder and more considerate to each other because i ve also seen obnoxious behaviour being normalised and encouraged especially with the rise of social media you never know if your actions could completely harm and crush another person for life so please think before you do anything ,1,False,xcmimi_mo,used to love it...,Instagram
2020-11-22 01:56:34,i really really dislike the new update and it s honestly making me consider deleting instagram this not something i d say lightly as i have 3 separate instagram accounts and have had the app since 2012 the main issue is that the features that everyone tends to use the most have been crammed into a hard to find corner the likes comments follow requests section and the add new post button need to go back on the easy to access bar at the bottom of the screen it is ridiculous that an app made for sharing photos should replace an add photo button with an endless stream of random videos reels just because developers feel like they need to compete with apps like tiktok the shopping section is just as unnecessary to have on the bar at the bottom as this feature is going to be used far far less than the add new post button the likes comments follow requests section or even the direct messages section because as i ve said instagram is an app used for sharing photos instagram is at serious risk of being just as complicated difficult to navigate and overcrowded as facebook instagram s simplicity and singular purpose photo sharing was what attracted people to the app in the first place please please please fix this asap i want to enjoy using instagram again ,2,False,megs1464,Awful New Update,Instagram
2017-12-03 23:51:49,would just like to say one of the very few things i can fault about ig is the algorithm at the very least please have it as an option where you can choose to have it in the actual order the posts are or in the current algorithm it s very very annoying and i believe the whole idea is ridiculous considering the vast majority of instagram users follow individual accounts because they want to see what they post and not always what you would consider the most popular account s posts it s frustrating seeing posts from friends pop up on my newsfeed that are only being shown to me now despite being posted 4 days ago no sense to it it makes it hard to keep up with people especially if they post frequently and all their posts come up in a random order on my timeline if at all also often instagram shows me many posts in my timeline which i have already seen and even liked and commented on already so it makes it hard to know when i ve finished looking through my feed because i don t know whether to stop on posts i ve already seen because i know that posts after i may not have seen because if this stupid algorithm please fix i know you would make so so many users happy if you did thank you,3,False,IMPORTANT SNAPCHAT👆,ALGORITHM!😞,Instagram
2019-12-29 11:34:16,i have been using instagram for years now and it has been great however i have one main concern it s unfair that we are not able to delete a single picture from a carousel upload but will have to delete the entire post containing all the pictures instagram should consider giving its audience the ability to delete a single picture from multi pictures we upload in one post sometimes we can have a change of mind about a particular picture or just a mere mistake but the fact that we can t take that particular picture down but the entire post is extremely appalling considering how big instagram is you have us the option to upload more than one picture therefore we should be given the option to delete a picture we don t want to show on profile anymore without having to take down the entire post instagram should do better i look forward you this feature or at least if we can t delete give us the option to archive that particular picture from the carousel of pictures we don t want to show on profile rather than archiving the entire post as well ,4,False,___klaudz,Ability to delete a single picture for multi upload,Instagram
2019-10-09 23:39:06,recently instagram has removed one of it s features that allows you to browse through what people like comment who they follow etc i d recommend that if instagram has chosen to remove the feature of browsing through what people have liked etc why can it be created into a option to have within the app so for people who wish to still have it they can turn it on within the app for people who don t want need it they can turn it off within the app that way it is equal for the people who still enjoy using this feature within the app but at the same time you acknowledge the people who don t need that feature and therefore gives them the option to turn it on or off however like myself there are a lot of other instagram users who are very unhappy about the removal of this feature i can strongly agree with them that it made the app a lot more interesting and exciting to use ever since the removal of this feature every time i go to use instagram it feels pretty pointless the feature connected everyone together by seeing what posts each other likes and comments on what new accounts other users have found and potentially could have interest to you as well i believe instagram will lose users if they don t reverse this removal of browsing through activity ,1,False,Em0703,Removing the Activity Feature - Bring it back!,Instagram

2018-03-01 11:06:17,so instagram has been my favourite app now for a long time i use it for both personal and business at first when the algorithm changed it was super annoying as the whole point is i m following people who i want to see posts from not a million ads and suggestions anyway eventually i got used to it but lately i ve been noticed more changed and it s just getting worse and worse majority of the posts i m seeing are from days ago and most the time from accounts i don t care to see as much showing me posts from days ago also puts me off from liking and commenting as it makes me feel like i ve been stalking through their account when in reality i ve only just seen the post this has also affected my business page too the reach is so much lower than previously despite using hashtags and occasionally sponsoring posts to try and get acknowledged but even then it s only bringing in a few hundred views if i m lucky when i used to get up in the thousands how you are expected to run a business through instagram is beyond me as each day i m losing followers thanks to the algorithm as nobody can see me post which means a loss of customers too slowly starting to consider deleting the app all together and finding a new platform with a chronological algorithm ,2,False,AshleighWilliamson96,Algorithms is horrendous,Instagram

2018-07-16 17:06:36,i personally think that instagram is really good and inspirational because they sometimes but mostly all the time have inspiring posts and quotes to help us through our day and make sure that we are happy another reason why i think that instagram is really good is because when your bored or have nothing to do and just sat around you can look about what your friends have been posting and seeing what they have been up to that week if you don t see them allot and you can also get in touch with your friends or family or even anybody that you know when you have instagram you can also go on the search page which shows you people doing make up or anything like that but if you are a lad and you don t like to watch makeup tutorials they are loads of different things which you will know what they are by the subtitles they are described with this is one of my favourite apps to spend some of my day on it relaxes me and nourishes me i think this should have always got positive reviews on because there is nothing bad to say about it x amazing nothing bad to say lucie xoxo,5,False,lucie ❤️🥂,Instagram,Instagram

2022-12-07 10:27:00,i ve never been so frustrated and disappointed with this app in the many years i ve had it since december 1st this app has been awful stories don t load and there s still no button to either cancel stop the story or just an option to delete if the app finds an error all while loading when the loading screen is all dark i know that i have lost that story and no it s nothing to do with my internet as following photo stories load perfectly it s been frustrating to maintain a good flow for my december vlogmas via stories also no captions for me for some reason and yes everything is ticked for it to have the caption appearing while i speak it can be read as xenophobic if certain regions are left out lives don t have the forward or rewind ability anymore nor the pause why i should have the power over how i want to re watch a live that has been saved another thing is the ability to play music in a photo post if you tag a shop for a specific product on the photo tapping on the photo will turn on off the sound but no tag placement will show up the tag button only shows the people you tagged but no correlation to the pertaining product it needs more work ,2,False,Yiannitsa,Disappointed,Instagram
2020-12-14 20:47:04,honestly i m thinking of deleting it i could spend the whole review complaining about how bad the algorithm is like everyone else or that ads are completely taking over my feed to the point that i haven t seen posts stories my friends have posted until about a week later however my main issue is a follow problem whether it s a new update or what instagram won t let any of my accounts follow people without removing the follow the next day the support team have been atrocious at getting back to me as well i have emailed in twice about this problem logged out and then back in and also deleted the app and reinstalled it however there still hasn t been an improvement the app s issue is that it s being saturated with ads and is mostly now an app to try and influence you to buy things whether it s clothes or phone accessories or whatever else it s no longer for you to post photos and the personal touch it used to have is now gone i also feel as though this review is not going to help because of the immense size of this app but anyway just don t get it it s pointless and dying better off finding some other better social media platform which will actually let you see who you follow and also actually let you follow people ,1,False,Rach28959392,Following problem and algorithm is AWFUL,Instagram
2019-12-15 08:10:52,i used to love checking instagram out and posting my own things however instagram seems to think that it s ok to infest it with adds it has been way too much recently 1 to 1 1 post 1 add seriously please give it a rest this poor people companies paying for that and no one actually stop to seem it properly and what about that algorithm conversation why am i seeing adds with cats kids bingo dog food fake nails adult diaper and so on when have i ever followed commented or searched about that before so instagram algorithm add would think that was ok to select this kind of random stuff and ruin instagram experience for me and for a lot of people i know too i have been asking around and a lot of friends can t be bothered checking instagram that often anymore i wish you guys would have an add free option if rather get a paid version than this nightmare i just don t like checking instagram out anymore which is a pity as i do like the people companies bloggers i follow i d appreciate it a lot if instagram could give it a pause on the volume of adds on my instagram please thanks,4,False,KVB74,Way too many adds please give it a rest!,Instagram
2019-06-02 10:11:02,as someone who suffers with horrible anxiety and severe depression i cannot abide by an exact rule system in order to get my content seen i will gladly use all of instagrams tools when i want to and how i want to but not when i m already overwhelmed with real life and now instagram the place i escaped to is becoming a chore of which i need to tick boxes in order for my hard work to even be seen this platform used to be an amazing environment of which i could express myself creatively how i want and when i want now it feels almost like a sick unattainable game now i need to be uploading a specific amount each day week despite being totally overwhelmed with how much i need to create or else i m punished as your employees have put it in this day and age does instagram really think they are paving the way by totally ignoring the impact instagram can have on mental health the depleting followers of your users isn t inspiring us to follow your rules it s making us feel horrible useless ignored and insignificant i feel that if this app continues to dictate what users should upload when and where that there will be a major pr disaster in terms of ignoring mental health and everyone will move to eventually an app that can allow creatives to explore their own creativity how and when they want on their own terms ,1,False,meganflock,It’s gone majorly downhill,Instagram
2019-06-04 10:33:01,when a company is so big and powerful as instagram they can do what they want even if users are disappointed with things they keep using the app as it s important for them not to lose their followers or social media status one thing of many things which upsets me as a user of this app is what many other users are not aware of instagram have forbidden hashtags yes they do have forbidden hashtags and they keep changing so there is no way that you would know until they actually shadow ban you they do let you post the forbidden hashtag without informing you that it s forbidden and then they put your account in shadows they don t even inform you that they have put your account on shadow banned mode you can only tell that your account acts less powerful and the worst thing is that you don t know for how long it will be shadow banned plus there is no support from instagram at all instagram will be old news at some point and it s only because they are to money driven and care less about individual user experience same reason that you can t see if someone has unfollowed you without using a third part app an app which instagram can recognise as a bot and put your account in a shadow banned mode good luck to the future of social media until the next new things comes ,1,False,Lowe H Seger,Could be better,Instagram

2022-11-03 17:33:04,i like instagram as i can look back through a pictorial history of some of the fun things i have done over the last 5 years i can connect with my adult kids friends and people i follow where can it improve firstly not by more adverts it may need revenue but it s starting to get a bit ad heavy since these don t have to be genuine companies i urge people are on guard for scams secondly in all my time i have never searched for animals it s not my thing so why do they keep putting animals such as snakes spiders sharks cute kittens etc in my suggested posts i always mark as not interested and it would be great if these didn t keep popping up lastly this is something for the pros there are some great professional influencers but can there be a limit on how many pictures you put up of yourself you are beautiful but apparently you don t have a life only different outfits and various stages of undress this is damaging the mental wellbeing of your followers people are becoming image obsessed and see a life of doing nothing as a career help them show some aspect of a positive lifestyle i am sure you do more than play dress up all day ,3,False,MDC£££,Good and bad,Instagram

2022-05-08 09:17:57,instagram is a social media app and i enjoy using it to stay in touch with my friends and use group chats to send posts but every time they add features it makes the app even more frustrating to use it genuinely feels like they re just trolling us at this point i wish they d think about their users more and how design choices can negatively affect the app i understand that people don t like change even if the change is positive but i genuinely think the new instagram features tend to be quite useless and frustrating for the majority in addition to this i wish the app was better for posting i mean it s a photo video focused app everytime i try to post multiple videos or pictures they automatically crop and zoom in really close i have tried everything to prevent this such as using external apps to change the sizes of my pictures to fit instagram and keeping all my pictures the same size but no matter what i do it still does the weird crop zoom thing i think it might be a bug and it s a bit annoying that i have to constantly use other apps just to post more than one picture ,3,False,Pocokitty,Decent but issues,Instagram

2022-05-29 21:49:23,instagram is one of my least favourite apps to use everything about the app is annoying to navigate and makes me feel like i m using an app with little effort put in despite being such an enormous company to list a few examples reels will continuously play in the background tapping the screen to pause it only mutes the video which is absurd and reading comments with the video playing the background is a drain on your battery i often find myself rewatching reels and the video starts bouncing encouraging me to move on to the next video as if any modern tech user does not know how to watch the video the timeline makes no sense they are random photos from random people you follow in no particular order you also can not edit or delete comments which anyone would have thought was a necessity i rarely review and only review when the app makes me angry and a change is desperately needed everything about the app goes against common sense 2 stars for the popularity so i can keep track with people and the dm is good with the seem less deleting of messages and clean look ,2,False,idonotreviewoften,"Outdated features, feels like a cheap app.",Instagram

2019-11-03 04:08:05,i m using instagram since 2010 almost a decade every year and with every new update a lot of issues coming along after using it for ten years it came to the point where all the following issues i ll mention put me into a serious consideration to delete this app and never use it again and of course that s the reason i m rating it with only 1 star i rated it with 5 stars a couple of years ago and if i could with zero 1 several times my account has been blocked without me actually taking any action or trying to go against the community guidelines apparently someone tried to hack me or tried to share my account with various services that provide likes followers and other stuff without my permission on the top of that the block was supposed to be expired on a specific date but that never happened 2 i v spend hundred of pounds promoting my music and my profession in general and most of the promotions didn t actually work or met my criteria of the budget i set and it didn t reach the number of people audience it should do perhaps it was a waste of money and i will never use the promotion ever again 3 i requested instagram three times to verify my account with all the criteria passed and non of my attempts was successful at least i would like to know the reason i was approved i hope this review will help people using it and instagram in general to sort out some serious issues ,5,False,rafigaroael3,Getting worse and worse,Instagram
2022-10-23 14:41:43,instagram was great until i recently updated it and now it s nothing but problematic there have been numerous occasions where i am unable to post a reel because the option is missing from my account posts photos are fine but not reels furthermore the reel icon is missing from my account so i can t even view other reels this has been occurring for over a month now and judging by posts comments online it seems like i m not the only one reporting the problem to instagram leads to more problems for instance after making a report the reel icon appears temporarily and permits me to post a reel but unfortunately the description tags hashtags and location is all missing and attempting to edit the post and add all the missing content doesn t seem to work either so all i have is a posted reel without any information whatsoever which means i won t have any engagement on it please bring back the old version or fix all the current issues so that instagram can be fun again instead of being a major headache instagram is trying very hard to be the tiktok by promoting reels but it doesn t even work perhaps it s time to head over to tiktok ,1,False,SpK2022,New Update Problematic,Instagram

2018-06-03 04:02:09,it would be reasonable if instagram could have an option to where you can delete a photo when you post multiple pictures in a slide hopefully you understand what i mean sometimes you post multiple pictures together and change your mind on one of them out of the rest or currently what i m going through i posted a picture of a loved one who has now passed and i noticed that when i posted my slid of pictures one of them came out in bad quality to the rest i want to delete that one picture out of the slide i don t want to have to delete the whole post please make this an option on your next update instagram also the commenting section is getting annoying i could comment that ain t it or this was on twitter too and instagram will tell me that my comment is inappropriate or violates the policy surely that s wrong and when i report it as a mistake i never hear back from instagram i genuinely need help with these things and it seems like instagram don t care overall i still like instagram i just need help it also applies to many people ,3,False,please help URGENT,😕,Instagram

2020-04-28 00:25:24,super cell this change should be considered greatly i find that it s too hard for you to upgrade your base in builder hall to max since the costs are high and you can only get a lot of loot from the star bonuses which you basically can only do once a day so this is what you should change you should apply different ways that a player can earn loot for their builder base such as the challenges in clan games e g win 3 games using at least 4 archers which they can complete for extra loot this will allow players who prefer to max their base to have a more even ground against rushed builder halls because they can max their base quicker since they don t have to wait as long to get loot honestly it takes way too long to be able to upgrade builder halls after maxing their base unlike in town halls because it s easier to earn more loot there since you can steal loot so they should implement new ways to receive loot in the builder base because it s hard to climb in trophies against other rushes bases which takes to much effort to climb trophies just to get an extra 20k loot every 200 trophies that you can only receive once a day please take my advice into account so that builder bases can be more enjoyable and more grindable instead of just being a base you log in once a day to get the star bonus wins,5,False,Mxmonga,Necessary change,Clash of Clans

2020-07-16 00:46:23,i have been playing this game since th8 was the max town hall level and i absolutely love it even after all these years its just a really good game that i think anyone and everyone could master i also like the social side of the game even though global is gone where you meet new people in clans and just have conversations with them for example what town hall level is your favourite and why one thing that supercell could add into the game to improve it massively is the ability to donate loot and by that i mean there could be a weekly or monthly event where you can donate and recieve loot in a clan the same way as you request for troops this could get out of hand if higher players donate loads to lower players so i thought it would be a good idea to cap the amount of loot you can recieve depending on your town hall level thanks for taking the time to read this review and i hope supercell will be implementing this into the game sometime the clan im currently in is called celtic clashers if anyone is interested we accept anyone ,5,False,zygazygazombie,"Brilliant and entertaining game, but could have one more thing to make it perfect",Clash of Clans

2021-08-14 21:01:32,first off i just want to say a massive well done to the developers of this game for making it so gosh darn fun and for keeping people playing after however many years it has been since this game release these ideas will make the game that smallest bit better 1 for people who like to focus on the builder base i think that there should be another way to get more loot considering that you get the mines and pumps but near the start they don t help much and battling others does help and i have found that you climb trophies way too easily trying to get loot this way maybe you could implement some sort of quests thing that you can complete to get enough loot to upgrade something at your builder hall level 2 i know many other people might disagree with me on this but when people attack your base i believe that they should earn the same amount of trophies that they do now but the amount that you loose shouldn t be so much i loose so many trophies because of the amount of people that are attacking me my suggestion is that the amount of trophies that you loose should be half the amount of trophies that the person that attacked you gained i think this is a fair amount and it also makes it so claiming trophies is easier because you don t loose as many i know this is a very long review but these are my ideas on how the game could be even better than how it is now i hope you take these ideas into some consideration ,5,False,kai 500,Ideas,Clash of Clans
2017-12-18 13:43:03,the idea behind the game is definitely a good one but it s almost as if the producers have lost their way everything is soooo expensive it takes an inordinate length of time to get anywhere which is why it s so tempting to buy gems to get the job done i understand it s a business and money must and should be made but not for everything the game is losing its intention please rationalise exactly what it is that the player is supposed to be achieving and how many of the weapon levels are just wrong when compared to the rest of the game items and army members also i m trying to update to the latest but it keeps taking me back to the home page where it tells me there s a new update available can we please just have an install button please i m still not updated also as i have requested before can we please have some way of seeing who it is that has donated troops rather than having to constantly say thanks to whoever donated we can t all be constantly sat in front of clash waiting to see who it was we need to earn some money in order to pay for the game items ,3,False,Nomad146,Great Game but Needs Attention,Clash of Clans
2020-04-10 21:09:59,generally it s an outstanding game but there needs to be some fixes over the years that i ve noticed as you grow and the bases get harder to raid if i had 30 more seconds i could got 3 star and sometimes getting 99 cos of a builder hut really makes me rage and i think adding 30 more seconds to attack time would really benefit the game so sad to see such an amazing game be let down because of some minor issues the other thing i noticed is that you hardly y win defences even tho my town hall 9 is nearly maxed defensive wise please change something about this and finally the cool down for hammer of hero s is way to long 7 days a week seriously personally i think it should be 3 days besides minor issues letting it down its the best supercell game i ve played boom beach clash royale and hay day coc is definitely the better one no questions asked so i beg you to fix these thing as i have said above but thank you for this awesome games,5,False,hshchucd,Things to make it better,Clash of Clans
2018-02-06 03:18:14,i really liked this game at first but now i ve been playing it for a long time i don t actually play it as such anymore it takes so long to earn enough money gems or elixir to build or do anything that i don t turn the game on for at least a week or sometimes longer i then literally turn it on take the money elixir and gems and turn it back off then after a few weeks when i ve got enough to actually build something i start the build going and then turn off the game again why cos it takes like 2 weeks to build anything now that s not a game that s boring and slow the only reason i don t delete the game is because i ve taken a long time to build up my clan but i think i m getting to the point where i will delete this game now purely cos it s not an enjoyable game anymore a game is something you want to play daily not something you can only play every couple of weeks for 5 mins ,5,False,Jayals,Good at first but slow and boring now,Clash of Clans
2022-05-02 12:52:31,ok i get it they have to keep you upgrading to keep it interesting but when upgrades take 2 weeks it is a little tiresome i could put up with this as it is part of how the game works but when more than one upgrade is required in each th cycle it gets dreary you work through upgrading 7 archer towers at however many days for each one then you have to do it again to keep levelled up personally i think some single use special troops spells or weapons that don t take up too much room would be fun to give you a one off rush and the chance to crush an opponent once in a while make them cost a certain level of coins so they aren t used every battle by everyone but they could add some much needed spice to go with the daily grind of upgrading and searching for likely marginal targets say buy an photon bomb for 1 000 000 something that would obliterate the middle of a base eagle artillery th and all it would also be nice to be able to fill your own siege machines ,4,False,Jonti007,Too many upgrades,Clash of Clans
2020-11-26 07:22:59,in my opinion this is one of the greatest games i have ever played but there could do with some changes the first change is in the builder base i think that there should be more than 2 ways to get loot in the builder base because people want to get things more often so there should be a way to get elixir and gold instead of collectors and battles once a day another feature that i quite personally would like is queuing builds and upgrades say i go to school and i m about to finish an upgrade but i m not allowed to go on my phone to start another one but if i queue it up before i get to school then it will be much more efficient to upgrade and build things i know some of my school mates who are in a clan with me would also agree to this being added even though these changes may not be added they should be and if people don t like it they can turn it off in there settings this is a brilliant game keep up the good work ,5,False,ShadowHunter304,Change needed,Clash of Clans

2020-10-20 20:05:36,i love this game and i don t want anyone at super cell to take offence to this but i feel you need to add things like when you go in to battle and collect loot you ride in on like a boat or something and you have to take loot back to that boat so your gold and elexier have to be stored on that but then you could add something like a goblin trap witch spawns goblins who will go and raid the boat for the loot back so you don t have to lose all of your stuff i suggest adding this at town hall 7 as that is a main town hall level thing i also think you should make the time it takes for town halls and other upgrades on your village and island should slow down i also think another builder on the builder base island other that the otto bot as it can be really tedious for lower town halls like me to upgrade as you can only do 1 at a time thanks from bob pls add meh and do what you can to make the game as goood as you have so far i just would really like you to make that final stretch best of luck from me,4,False,joe nickname not taken,Good but could be better,Clash of Clans

2018-12-10 22:11:13,yes i understand that supercell won t do much work on anything before the 2nd highest townhall level but as a townhall 9 i can safely say there are a few firstly why can you upgrade a wall twice at th9 to max out 1 wall at th9 from being max at th8 costs 1 5million resources why not just charge 800k and leave it to 1 level being max it doesn t change much as th9 players will either use wallbreakers and rage them jump spells or air troops i ve never attacked a base without 1 of these methods so it s pointless giving walls an extra 500 health for that price on another note the cost for upgrading hero s is too much as there are so many levels as i ve finished all upgrades and almost walls yes 2nd level upgrade as well and yet i ve only got level 15 heros love the upgrades you bring out regularly like the electro drake and now the ice golem but maybe you should add a couple things here and there to smaller th s even if it s limited potions for those th levels 1 other thing ignore everyone on the subject of gems i ve never spent a penny on this game and never not had gems you don t need to spam upgrades over and over and instantly upgrade them i have 5 builders buy the training potion and occasionally gem troops to clan mates the trees and bushes give more than enough and so do the achievements and clan games keep up the great work look forward to 2019 ,5,False,KOGuardian,Needs tweaks,Clash of Clans

2019-05-03 05:29:43,the game is great the battle helps you think more strategically and makes you think how can i be as efficient with troops and spells as possible the addition of the gem mine has helped i know it s been out for a while but here s the problem 4 99 for the gold pass that s ridiculous when the first season ended i did a check to see how many people brought the gold pass to get the hero skin out of the 25 searches none of them had the hero skins either they weren t online or didn t know how to equip them this shows that some other people don t want to pay 4 99 just for the hero skin if the hero skin was separate from the seasons and maybe in the clan league wars at a high price in game money not in app or maybe have the gold pass just for the special rewards and boosters and make the skins available to anyone then that would be a great idea other that s the gold pass the rest of the game is great ,4,False,BIG F UCKIn,Good but weighed down by the gold pass,Clash of Clans
2019-06-01 16:57:54,i love this game i think it s incredibly fun and a great game i have been playing since day 1 and a lot has changed i have 9 different accounts and two of which are maxed town hall 12 i love the fact that you can have multiple accounts but it s very frustrating when you have to log out then log in with another in a way i wish their was a way to access all accounts without having to always log in as well as this sometimes it s hard to remember all the different logins this is a crazy idea but could their ever be a new campaign where instead of us attacking goblin bases they would attack ours it probably wouldn t work but it would be quite cool also if their was a slight chance that clans could change their names it would be amazing but it should only be a 1 time thing any way clash on callum,5,False,Callum005,Please read supercell,Clash of Clans
2017-12-18 16:10:22,i love this game to bits and it s obvious how much time and effort has gone into it however there are some balancing issues as a player reaches the higher town halls 8 one huge issue is the cost of walls as even though they are not as expensive as any other building to upgrade there are 200 of them meaning that you will have to spend 500 000 gold on level 8 walls 200 times which is 100 000 00 gold and this is an estimate also as a lot of others have complained obviously the upgrade times for most buildings is extensively long and makes the game a little stale if someone s is unwilling to buy gems to speed up the process his makes this beautifully crafted game a little repetitive and boring sometimes but otherwise i think this is the most well developed mobile gaming ex out there jbone,5,False,Toshkent iop,"All around very good and developed game, however...",Clash of Clans

2020-09-13 09:51:48,this game is overall incredible but my only complaint is that when you get to a certain point in the game everything takes way too long building getting enough gems to make more builder huts and training troops another thing i forgot to mention is that you can only get loot from the builder island battles 3 times a day and that s only from winning too you get put in a loop of i need more loot to get more defenses but i can t get loot because i m not winning any battles why is that because you don t have enough defenses the only ways to get around this is to either wait for your mines and collecters to get enough resources which takes an incredibly long time or constantly retry battles until you find someone who s really bad at the game which also takes a lot of time you probably won t see this review but if you do please take into consideration what i ve said ,4,False,W h a t e v s,Amazing except,Clash of Clans

2022-07-07 13:24:18,i really enjoy clash of clans it s particularly great when you find a good clan not only does this greatly increase how fast you can progress but the atmosphere of playing with friends is really good i am pretty pleased with resource balancing as well as it seems a lot more generous then it has been in the past and i am extremely grateful for that the changes made to walls and training troops are welcomed and definitely improve the game i also think the introduction of the clan capital is a good one it makes for a fun sort of mini game on the side of your home village and builders base you get out of clan capital what your clan puts in really if you have an inactive clan you won t find this much fun however clash of clans does have some serious glaring issues that prevent this game being a 5 star for me in particular progress on the builders base is still too stagnant it just feels pretty boring compared to home village or clan capital i am also still an avid supporter of global chat and still think it should return global allowed a lot more interaction between clans and the current system for finding clans is just not up to par overall i ll continue to play and have a good time supercell have been pretty good at consistently improving the game ,4,False,DDuelist,Enjoyable but changes needed.,Clash of Clans

2017-08-08 22:12:09,hi i think clash of clans is the most awesome game but i think there is a few things that could be better like private chat so u could go on social click one or yr friends and along with all the other stuff a button comes up saying chat or message or something cause maybe you want to talk to someone individually without leaving joining another clan or war strategies with just one person or little tips in war different one for everyone so that would be extremely useful also notifications when someone is on and talking in the clan so people are talking and sending messages in clan chat notifications come up so you can be like oh someone s finally on lets go talk or anything other wise a good game but 5 stars only if these things happen other wise i might stop because it s annoying always having to leave the clan to talk separately otherwise thanks for a great game please do these things please please please ,3,False,Sonia Khorami,Awesome but even better with....,Clash of Clans

2018-07-29 14:14:22,i like the game very much is very addictive but what annoys the most is that every time i find a base i actually have a chance of defeating it so happens to have over powered troops in it clan castle i don t mind the fact that you can have clan troops in your castle but i wish that they could only be a certain level or specific group for example say a base has a level three barracks and they request troops they should only be able to get troops that are accessible from a level three barracks this is because all the time my army gets absolutely destroyed before they can even bring down a building please do something about this atleast make it so the attacker doesn t loose trophies if they loose from a battle with overpowered troops defending the base anyways this game is great when there are bases without clan troops in the castle i will rate this two stars for the great gameplay but three stars taken away from that mishap ,2,False,Everyone likes everyone,I can’t win! 😡,Clash of Clans

2020-07-03 15:49:54,a real good game but the problem is it takes too long to get gems and if you don t have gems you have to wait days or even weeks for an upgrade of corse you could buy them but that costs a lot too also i don t like the new battle pass thing it s really not good but apart from those two things it really good game like i would suggest it to a friend but gems take too long to get and after a while of getting it gets quite boring and quite frustrating it take seven hours for my troops to finish it is a real good game tho hope this comment helps and if you haven t downloaded you should also i don t see many of the bugs and errors so that bits fine still tho an amazing game ,5,False,alfiejay999999,Gems,Clash of Clans
2019-04-02 23:36:53,ive played this game for a couple of years and with my experience i have realised that there is no true way a player is rewarded with the grind they have put in if i spent a week grinding for an upgrade for a defence i should receive some sort of reward instead of waiting 1 2 weeks for the defence to upgrade and then start again rewards can be as simple as receiving a training potion boost for farming 1 2 million gold in a day just something to keep the player motivated and farm more this game has alot of potential to expand its player base in the future especially if they make it easier to progress early mid game instead of playing for 2 3 years and being a mid th10 only because of this reason i would give this game 4 stars as the other aspects of the game are amazing ,4,False,Kakaniki,Game should have a rewarding factor,Clash of Clans
2022-12-11 17:05:35,i would give 4 and half but seems you it s an amazing game with the ability to customise you own base build a base with your clan you also have secondary base that is less time effective too keep you active it s a very easy to understand however with personal experience don t okay too much other wise you just burn yourself out play for an hour a day max and go on when you have builders otherwise you will be burnt out after a few months and won t play again for a little while slowing down your progress my only downside is you have to pay to get to the highest town hall there is no way if you a no pay players that you will ever reach the top town hall alone with the high costs of building and very long building times ,4,False,joshmorales43,Very good,Clash of Clans
2018-10-27 11:27:40,the best element of this game used to be clan wars where you could select participants from your clan who would then be matched algorithmically with another clan at a similar level of development it resulted in fun competitive wars which rewarded skill in the game then came clan war leagues each league had 8 clans which play each other over the course of 7 days however the war participants are limited to 15 a side meaning that the clans that put up their 15 strongest bases each time are sure to win as a result the less developed bases never get a look in these lower bases therefore no longer have the chance to join wars and in our clan many loyal players have already stopped playing or left the clan as a result ,5,False,Boulevardier,Superb game ruined by clan war leagues,Clash of Clans
2020-05-12 18:28:40,i can t actually say that there is anything bad about this game it s still as great as it was when it launched i do have one idea about an improvement that can be made to the clanning system that has been tossed around the coc community a lot lately that improvement is maybe the leader of a clan can choose to change the clan name once for free if the surrounding people find the name babyish or offensive and then if they want to change the name again they will have to pay 800 gems for it i think this idea is similar to the change name option in clash royale and i think it can be a viable option to be implemented into the world of clash of clans other than that 5 stars from me ,5,False,FrjTodayYt,Absolutely outstanding but one improvement...,Clash of Clans
2021-01-13 21:30:54,i have been a clash player for years i love this game but i really think supercell need to consider the time of upgrades it is ridiculously to long to wait for example if you are about to upgrade your troops please make sure that you are healthy and not going to die anytime soon as your life will probably end before the upgrade the time scale of waiting is way to long which will make new players think to delete the game at an early stage rather than give it a few weeks other than the time scale if you can get past the wait you will never delete this game it is addictive but as i say the time frame may make new users think to delete it and not be able to experience how good this game is ,5,False,gazza0121ukdnb,Review,Clash of Clans
2018-12-08 16:22:10,i have been playing this game for around 4 years i have bought gems who can resist it am i right and i am town hall 10 one problem i had when i was in town hall 9 was that there is too many levels to upgrade for heroes you need to upgrade 50 levels worth of heroes in total also when i am upgrading a barracks i get really frustrated by the fact that it adds more time to the training time of the troops this is really annoying and it really discourages me to upgrade my barracks as it will take way longer to train my army for example an army i trained used to take 40 mins but now when i was upgrading the barracks it took 1hr and 20mins besides this i really like the game it s fun to play it s addicting and it s satisfying no game has been alive for this long and still is going strong if there is it s not my point p i recommend this game to anyone as it isn t graphic for kids and it isn t childish for adults i love this game and can t wait to see it progress a few additions could be to make more tiers for clan games it s pretty easy to get to tier 6 and it would be better for the better clans to get more and better rewards this is what i think of the game and good luck ilxgxnd,4,False,Joshzebrowski,Amazing but...,Clash of Clans

2017-10-11 09:59:33,this game is amazing because you get two different worlds which is builder base and original base i like the original base better because it is harder to max out you get better troops and bigger and better town halls one thing i would like to add though is to make it so you can search up players name i now you can do that but it doesn t work because when you type up someone s name it says this name does not match please try again which annoys me a bit because i just won t to type up someone s name and it doesn t work another i want is another town hall and different troops and new defences and maybe a new hero which would be amazing hopefully you read this and do the updates please do the updates ,5,False,Mrskilt,This game is amazing,Clash of Clans

2018-04-16 22:16:23,i would like to suggest something to this game as i personally think it would make it slightly better the new update has added an option with clan war tool i think anyway it s good because you can clam people and add notes but i don t think that is enough i believe to make this new clan war tool better is to people able to click on the players base and say for instant you mark a place on the base that would be good to attack for example they is a base with a weak point and one player notices this he would click on the area mark it and say weak point in base or say for another example attack from these position please consider as they may help some clan out there that struggle with clan wars,5,False,CJ connolly01,Clash of clans,Clash of Clans

2023-01-14 02:13:50,i ve had this app for a little over a year now i was expecting the ads so i was fine with that what i was not expecting was the ongoing problem of listening to a playlist for it to all of a sudden cut off saying video is unavailable or something like that sometimes when an ad comes on i ve deleted the app reinstalled it it did go away at one point after an update but it s back it s annoying because i either have to hope it didn t interrupt my playlist to the point i have to start again or listen to a different playlist and hope the same thing doesn t happen there sometimes i can go back to listening to the playlist and other times it s brings me to a suggested playlist i ve tried googling the problem and they just said to completely delete the app off the phone and reinstall it and i ve done that but it is still a problem i am facing what the hell is even wrong at this point,4,False,scotomaphobia,Great but….,Spotify
2021-05-31 06:46:13,i absolutely love this app it has every song pretty much ever made on there i m addition you can also create your own playlists i ve had this app 5 years and i ve made 342 playlists the only fault in this app is the adds basically if you don t sign up to the premium package you get heaps of adds come up saying things like download the premium package today or get more in the premium package don t get me wrong i mean i know they need to advertise it some how but it just pops up out of nowhere and scares the hell outta me especially when you are listening to songs and basically just sitting there chillaxing then boom and add just appears out of nowhere me and my sister are both tired of this since we don t have the premium package so if you could change that then i would give this app 5 stars ,5,False,catcatcatlollipop2009,I ❤️ this app although there is one thing...,Spotify

2022-05-16 16:20:49,personally i think the app is great except for the massive expense of premium when you are listening to music without premium you cannot create a playlist without other songs being added which is very annoying as well as this you get up to 4 ads every so often and when one of the ads comes up and says watch this ad to get the next 30 minutes of listening ad free it does not do that also sometimes it randomly skips a song when i m listening to it on the positive side it s a great app if you want to enjoy listening to music freely it has almost every song and artist on there it s also a good app if you want to listen to some music without having to pay ridiculous amounts of money as well as this it offers a free 3 month period of premium i might get that soon overall pretty good app ,4,False,TheSmolFanOfRoblox,pretty good :),Spotify
2018-04-12 14:12:03,to all the people complaining about the free version get over it for a free version it s amazing i mean you can still make your own playlist listen offline and search your own artists so what s the problem ads don t come on that often either which is a miracle if you think about it i mean i have been through so many music apps and most of them show me ads every two minutes i mean if you don t like having your playlist on shuffle or listening to the occasional ads then for god s sake just get the premium version when i first saw this i wanted to see whether it was worth paying for it is this app is amazing and tbh i honestly didn t mind shuffle before it was kind of a nice surprise to see which song came on next way better than apple music or deezer wish i could rate it more ,5,False,2737348,Amazing!!!,Spotify

2022-07-23 11:11:45,love this app very slick and usable well worth paying for especially with student discount the platform is great for discovering new artists and trying to build up an audience there are still some bugs which come up here and there which i guess arise as a result of app updates in line with software updates across the phones themselves one which is problematic is changing pictures for playlists and profiles every time i try to update the pictures on playlists the app crashes using iphone 11 with the latest ios when bugs like this are sorted i will update this review to 5 stars because the app is pretty much the best music app i ve ever used as an artist and as a listener ,5,False,🌈🍇🌿,"Great app, great platform, some bugs",Spotify
2019-07-20 09:49:59,app is usually good and the previous updates have been helpful and made the app easier to look at and navigate latest update however means that you can no longer sort through songs artists and albums alphabetically and it takes a lot longer to find what you re looking for as everything is out of order you can also now not reach your recently played songs when you are not connected to the internet as the list has been moved to the home page this has been a huge inconvenience it is also now impossible to listen to all saved songs in shuffle as due to the new liking system all your saved songs must be liked as well as saved in order to listen to them all on shuffle in the same place which means i must now go through and make sure every song is liked the app is now more difficult to use and i wish i had not updated ,2,False,Tinybird300,new update is trash,Spotify

2023-03-22 23:53:17,it s a terrible app considering the number of users and it s place in the market my biggest complaint is that i feel it s more designed for people that don t process a taste in music i want to build playlists over time i don t want suggestions in the same place i want to curate my own lists i find it is mostly geared towards promoting trending music and podcasts which is fine i just want to be able to have my own personal user experience if i search for music by a artist i want to see the songs i search for clearly separate from the 40 other songs that also appear or if i search for an artist i just want to see their back catalogue presented in chronological order of when it was released remixes and compilation albums should appear separate from the official catalogue i find everything cluttered together and non user friendly ,2,False,Fuzzlove,Terrible ap,Spotify

2021-12-28 15:40:47,good but there are some problems every so often it undownloads all of my playlists and songs for some reason which means that my phone is trying to download thousands of songs all at once which makes my phone really slow so i pretty much can t use it for a couple of days another problem is that it constantly stops my music so if i m listening normally with headphones or on a speaker it pauses my music every couple of seconds so i have to keep on pressing play which gets incredibly annoying after a couple of hours of listening apart from those two problems this app is great and way better than apple music ofc ,5,False,poppyelizabeth01,Good but some problems.,Spotify

2021-12-03 11:39:47,it s a good app but i ve used others what are free with some better features for example you should be able to move songs up and down your playlist i know you can sort your songs by artist order exc however you should be able to move your song yourself because if your like me you like your songs in a specific order you should be able to grab the song and be able and move it wherever you like also you need to have more songs on your platform this isn t an easy issue you can resolve however would be great if i saw some other songs on there what i don t have eventually,5,False,Great Music Player,To be able to Move songs,Spotify

2022-09-19 09:08:06,it s a good app but you need to have premium to do anything even to listen to your playlists yeah ik that sounds stupid but it s true you also can t pick the song in a playlist unless you have premium and you can t put the song back to the beginning and u also can only skip a couple of songs per hour i only really listen to podcasts on it because they are basically the only thing you can actually listen to properly the adds are really annoying as well and they are basically in between every song and u can only skip the adds if you have premium so if ur willing to pay for premium then it s a good app to listen to songs on but if u can t pay premium it s not worth the time xx,3,False,tiles hop liver,It’s alright,Spotify
2021-02-02 15:50:01,first of all i want to start with the amount of songs there are in this app if i search up a song it s there secondly this app has playlists so that you can list the songs in different places say you want a george ezra playlist you can find his songs and add them to your playlist also you can listen to song when you are away from the app your phone is off and connect it to a speaker it s amazing so if you are looking for a music app were you just want to listen to music and relax while saving a ton of battery i completely recommend this for you ,5,False,Yeetamous1,Absolutely incredible,Spotify
2018-05-20 14:55:38,used to love the app but the new update is an absolute joke just got a job and was about to buy premium until i opened up the app and saw the ridiculous new version you ve for some strange reason decided to upload i can t see the queue anymore when connected to my xbox the songs don t skip either by my hand or when the current song ends so i have to either turn it off or listen to the same song on repeat and now when listening to a song i can t shortcut to the album i have to find the artist s page and rifle through all the albums to find it the purpose of an update is to improve not to deteriorate and by the looks of other reviews i m not the only one unimpressed holding off premium for now i m not paying for this mess ,2,False,Mushroom with Croutons,More disappointed with you than my parents are with me.,Spotify
2022-11-22 16:13:23,on a good day everything works as it should the menus aren t the most intuitive for example it takes far too many clicks to do something as simple as changing the equaliser the high quality sound is a big plus however too often for any app but especially for a paid premium proposition it simply will not play anything at all moreover in such circumstances the absence of an error message just adds to the frustration leaving no identifiable way forward the only resolution i ve found is to completely restart my phone this is also a longstanding problem seemingly with no hope that it will ever be fixed when driving this is a particularly dangerous distraction simply not good enough ,2,False,TW1250,Good when it works but very frustrating when it doesn’t,Spotify
2020-07-14 18:09:48,when i got this app i was very intrigued by all the good reviews it had got so i decided to get and i was very impressed this app is wonderful it has a variety of things to listen too from music to podcasts and the good thing is it s free music which really is something i highly recommend this app but the downside is the adverts come one every 3 songs you listen too so to stop that you have to get premium which you have to pay even though this happens you get used to it and sometimes the ads are actually helpful overall i m very impressed and would highly recommend ,5,False,Truthful H,"Brilliant app,very impressed",Spotify
2021-04-24 13:15:06,sometimes when i use the app it starts to randomly kick me out and sometimes the song doesn t start and i have to press the stop button a couple of times before it restarts except that everything is amazing and i love the new widgets ps would love if you guys could maybe in the future add more of a social side to the app maybe give users some sort of a page that they can play around and edit and recommend song to their friends or maybe you can add a comment section to some of the songs also more recommendations on my home page please,5,False,the Yotube dude,App is great except a couple of bugs,Spotify
2020-07-04 08:36:11,on not premium on ipad it s just fine you can skip a lot of songs instead of 6 but only if your not on a smart speaker without premium but on phone its a different story when i i staled it i could not chose my songs you could do that on ipad and only 6 scipps my mum uses not premium on her galixy s 20 and she hates how every song is on a radio and when you make a small playlist you put on songs you don t even know i like or know but they do go the more songs you put on and you can chose you songs on daily mixes and there the only songs you can actually chose and we nearly use our daily mixes so yes but im rating it 4 stars because of those little things on phones,4,False,roblox8an lover,Good on tablet and ipad,Spotify
2019-02-28 10:42:39,latest update hasn t changed the app too much for me but it has greatly downgraded my user experience with just a couple of seemingly tiny but very annoying little changes that affect me every time i use the app for example the options to have shuffle and loop have now been removed from the now playing screen which means you have to click to find them further to this shuffle and loop issue i have to select shuffle and loop every single time i change playlist or reopen the app before it used to remember that i always want my playlists to be on shuffle and loop so that i get different orders of songs and it doesn t just stop playing when it plays the last song on the playlist minor changes but really irritating and just making the ux worse ,2,False,Pjjsonm,Same but annoying little changes,Spotify
2018-10-27 12:46:03,amazing app but i would like to know which songs are downloading what i mean is sometimes when an artist releases new music it gets automatically downloaded when i open the app i see that for example 15 songs are downloading but i don t know if i want to download them because i haven t listened to them can you make it so that when i click on the downloading tab i can see the songs that are downloading at the moment and maybe be able to decide if i want them or not because every time i open the app songs are downloading and then i don t know which are they that s the only reason i m rating it 4 5 because it fills my phone storage with songs i don t even listen to thank you ,4,False,смьон,Suggestions,Spotify
2022-03-31 09:14:44,i used to love listening to songs on this until recently when it stopped letting me use the songs as back round sound while i do other things on my other things on my iphone now i have to stay on the app in order to continue using the songs i cannot even turn my phone off while listening to this songs meaning i can no longer fall asleep while listening to music unless i want it to suddenly stop when my phone automatically turns off other than that i love to listen to music on it update i just updated the app it s letting me listen to the songs as back round noise loving the app so far ,4,False,Madi_9865,Listening to the music,Spotify
2018-09-13 20:47:41,premium user here this app used to be amazing it s ui is intuitive and easy to learn and it s discover tab is spot on with suggesting music for me recently though i ve been having issues on both my phone and ipad if i download playlists they periodically delete themselves and have to be downloaded again issue is that it deletes itself in the background and only downloads when the app is open meaning that when i want to use the app offline i just end up with multiple tracks missing it s lost a feature it used to have where you could edit what songs were coming up in the playlist as well as in the queue it also no longer maintains the play queue when you switch devices ,3,False,LowerCrust,"Used to be 5 star App, but not anymore",Spotify
